## Exam tables

The exam tables (i.e. the collection of techniques for each exam) do not have a specific license that I am aware of. In
any case, you should not modify the tables and claim that they are the original ones.

## Logos

The logos of

- the Aikido Föderation
- and the Aikido Dojo Darmstadt

are property of those respective institutios.
