## Are you prepared for your next exam?

Do you know all the techniques that you need to know? Do you know them from your heart? Can you show a technique
_instantly_ without thinking about it?

## How do you prepare for this?

We usually don't practice that skill in training. Instead, we practice the same technique over and over again and try to
fix all the little mistakes that we make along the way.

This is valuable, and you _should_ fix all the little mistakes.

But for the exam, I suggest you meet with two friends as well and play "examination": One names random techniques, the
other one attacks you, and you try not to think, just show the technique.

## How to create a list of random techniques?

You can sit down with a printed exam table and choose random techniques on the fly. If you want to choose techniques
quickly and without bias, I suggest you use this website.

Choose your dojo, choose your grade.

Let your friend read the techniques, or your smartphone!
